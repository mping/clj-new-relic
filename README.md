# clj-new-relic

A Clojure library designed to help trace clojure functions

## Installation

Add this to your Leiningen project.clj `:dependencies`:

    [clj-new-relic "0.1.0"]
    [com.newrelic.agent.java/newrelic-api "3.38.0"]

Jar is available in Clojars.


## Usage

Just replace your defn with `nr/defn`, after requiring `[clj-new-relic.core :as nr]`

   (clj-new-relic.core/defn foo-bar [x]
     (prn x))

## Using the newrelic agent

This library automatically checks for the newrelic classes at runtime. Hense, you may add new relic via the agent, and not include the dependency above
